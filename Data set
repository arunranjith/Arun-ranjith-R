1. MovieLens Dataset (by GroupLens)

Best choice for recommendation systems

Includes user ratings, movie metadata, tags, and timestamps

Variants: 100K, 1M, 10M, 20M, and 25M ratings

Example features: userId, movieId, rating, timestamp, genres, title


2. IMDb Datasets

Massive collection of movie data: ratings, cast, crew, genres, plot, etc.

More detailed metadata but lacks direct user-rating interactions (useful for content-based models)


3. The Movies Dataset (on Kaggle)

Combines metadata from IMDb and ratings from MovieLens

Includes user ratings, metadata (genres, cast, crew), and keywords

Good for hybrid (collaborative + content-based) recommendation models


4. Netflix Prize Dataset (historical)

Contains 100 million anonymized user ratings

No detailed movie metadata

Still useful for pure collaborative filtering research
